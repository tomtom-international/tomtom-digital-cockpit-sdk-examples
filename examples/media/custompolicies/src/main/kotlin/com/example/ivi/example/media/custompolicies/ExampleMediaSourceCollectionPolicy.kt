/**
 * This policy ensures that, when playing content from the example media source, collections are
 * correctly recognized as such. This ensures that when selecting a collection, the correct UI
 * layout will be used.
 *
 * Possible examples of a collection:
 * - a playlist.
 * - an album.
 * - an artist page (contains songs, albums, etc).
 * - a podcast page with a list of episodes.
 * - an audiobook (contains a list of chapters).
 *
 * The [DefaultCollectionPolicy] determines a collection based on collection media item with
 * [IviMediaItem.isPlayable] and [IviMediaItem.isBrowsable] properties. Here we change this default
 * behavior for this example source: a collection is determined if the media item id contains the
 * "playlist" string.

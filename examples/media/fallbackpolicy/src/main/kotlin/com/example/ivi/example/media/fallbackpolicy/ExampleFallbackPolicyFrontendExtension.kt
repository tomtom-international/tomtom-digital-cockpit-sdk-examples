/**
 * Stock media player UI extension to configure custom policies for non configured media sources.
 * The configured policies can be found in the [exampleFallbackPolicyProvider].
 *
 * Specifying non specifically configured media sources here is done by setting the
 * [MediaPolicyFrontendExtension.sourcePackageName] parameter to `null`. Only one such extension can
 * be in use in the build.
 *
 * An extension such as this one should replace the stock fallback policy which is normally provided
 * by default. This is done through the IVI configuration instance of the media player UI's
 * frontend at build time.
 * For details, see the `gradle.build.kts` file of this example and [FrontendExtension].

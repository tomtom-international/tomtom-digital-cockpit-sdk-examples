# Module examples_media_userflowpolicy

## Example user flow policy customization

This is an example demonstrating how to customize the browsing experience for a specific media
source in the TomTom Digital Cockpit stock media player UI.

The example demonstrates concepts explained in the
[Create a new media user interface](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/media/create-a-new-media-user-interface)
guide in the TomTom Digital Cockpit documentation.

To be able to try the customizations in this example, other than installing it on a device, it is
also necessary to compile and install the example module `examples_media_source`, as that contains
the media source customized by the current example. Trying another example or the template app will
clarify the differences even more.

# Module examples_media_customnowplaying

## Example custom media now playing

This is an example demonstrating how to customize the media now playing panel with a customized UI 
visible when expanding a mini player.
The stock media player UI uses an expanded process panel to display what is currently being played. 
Every panel is able to create their own initial fragment. It's possible to adjust the look and 
behavior of a panel by customizing this fragment. A system UI host can create custom fragment rules 
that replace the stock fragment of a panel with a custom fragment.

This directory contains an example system UI that customizes the fragment of
`MediaExpandedProcessPanelBase`. It's possible to see this customization in action by following 
these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open this in Android Studio.
3. Run the `examples_media_customnowplaying` configuration.
4. Open the media frontend.
5. Select and play any media from any media source.
6. Tap on the current media metadata on the mini player.

The custom media now playing is now shown and its layout differs from the stock one.

The example demonstrates concepts explained in the following guides:
[Replacing a panels' fragment with a custom fragment](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/tutorials-and-examples/customization/custom-fragments)

To be able to try the customizations in this example, other than installing it on a device, it is
also necessary to compile and install the example module `examples_media_source`, as that contains
the media source customized by the current example. Trying another example or the template app will
clarify the differences even more.

## System UI integration note

This example only demonstrates how to make a new media playback UI; it does not provide an example
on how to place this UI in a different part of the screen, or on another display.

To accomplish those kinds of modifications, the
[System UI introduction](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/developers/development/system-ui)
contains more information about customizing the UI and create new panel types to integrate in it.

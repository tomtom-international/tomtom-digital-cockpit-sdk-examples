This file contains _empty_ values for the Amazon Alexa IDs. By default, these values are not used.
To use them:

- Configure the Amazon Alexa IDs in this file.
- Set the `disableAlexaDeviceIdBuildTimeCheck` property to `true` in your `local.properties` file
  located in the root project directory or as a Gradle property.

It is also possible to configure the Alexa IDs without any code changes. You can do this by setting
the `alexaDeviceInfoClientId` and `alexaDeviceInfoProductId` properties in the top-level
`local.properties` file or as Gradle properties. In this case you won't need to set
`disableAlexaDeviceIdBuildTimeCheck` to `true`.

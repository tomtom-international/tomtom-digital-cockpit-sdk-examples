# Alexa example application

## Introduction

This example app shows how to use the Alexa feature that comes with the TomTom Digital Cockpit
Platform. The
[TomTom Digital Cockpit Developer Portal](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/introduction)
explains how this app
[creates a custom Alexa Handler service](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/voice-personal-assistant/create-a-custom-alexa-handler-service#how-to-create-a-custom-alexa-handler-service).

By default, this app is excluded from the build, because it requires Alexa libraries that are not
publicly available. You must
[set a Gradle property](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/voice-personal-assistant/create-a-custom-alexa-handler-service#example-app)
to build this app.

## Alexa Car Control

One of the Alexa Auto features that will most likely need customizations for your own vehicle
requirements, is Car Control. The Car Control module enables an OEM to build a custom experience that
allows users to use Alexa to voice-control vehicle features.

Subdirectory `customcarcontrolhandler` holds example code showing how to define custom Alexa
CarControl endpoints and assets. For details see the
[Customize the Alexa Car Control Feature](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/documentation/tutorials-and-examples/voice-personal-assistant/customize-the-alexa-car-control-feature)
portal page.

## Alexa Preview Mode

Alexa Preview Mode allows users to get access to a set of Alexa features without requiring a login
with an Amazon account.

Subdirectory `alexapreviewmode` holds a simple example implementation of the 
[`AlexaPreviewModeService`](TTIVI_PLATFORM_API).
This service is responsible for handling communication with AVS (Alexa Voice Service) to enable or 
disable Alexa Preview Mode using the `InstantDeviceRegistration` API.

This service must be implemented if an OEM wants to use [Alexa Preview Mode in the setup flow](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-auto/setup.html).

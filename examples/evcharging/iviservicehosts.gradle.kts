/**
 * This file defines the IVI service host implementations and the list of interfaces hosted by
 * these IVI service hosts. The IVI service hosts are defined in this file so it can be used in all
 * Gradle subprojects, including tests.
 *
 * The properties defined in this file can be accessed in the `build.gradle.kts` files by applying
 * this file in the `build.gradle.kts` file and by using Gradle's extra extension.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * import com.tomtom.ivi.platform.gradle.api.common.iviapplication.config.IviServiceHostConfig
 * import com.tomtom.ivi.platform.gradle.api.framework.config.ivi
 *
 * apply(from = rootProject.file("iviservicehosts.gradle.kts"))
 *
 * val androidAppSourceProviderServiceHost: IviServiceHostConfig by project.extra
 *
 * ivi {
 *     application {
 *         enabled = true
 *         services {
 *             addHost(androidAppSourceProviderServiceHost)
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * ...
 * ```
 *
 * The preceding example obtains the `androidAppSourceProviderServiceHost` property as defined in this
 * file and adds the IVI service host to the IVI application.
 *
 * To allow the Gradle's extra extensions to work, the properties in this file need to use the
 * `by extra` delegation to assign the value.

# Using a custom panel container in system UI

System UI in the TomTom Digital Cockpit visualizes data represented by `Panel`s. How panels are
positioned relative to each other, how they are animated or if they can be dismissed - all this
coordination is defined by the `PanelContainer` which displays the concrete `Panel`. The closest
counterpart of a `PanelContainer` in Android OS is a
[ViewGroup](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup).
In fact, all `PanelContainer`s that come with TomTom Digital Cockpit are based on
[ViewGroup](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewGroup) and implement the
`PanelContainer` interface. You can see all `PanelContainer`s used by stock system UI in the package
`com.tomtom.ivi.platform.systemui.api.common.systemuihost.panelcontainer`.

This example shows how to create a custom `PanelContainer` to display two `CustomPanel`s
side-by-side. It's possible to see this custom `DualPanelContainer` in action by following these
steps:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Open it in Android Studio.
1. Run the `examples_customization_custompanelcontainer` configuration.
1. See two panels on the screen.

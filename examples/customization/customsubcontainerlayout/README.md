# Using a custom sub-container layout

The system UI of the TomTom Digital Cockpit is built with `PanelContainer`s, that control
how `Panel`s are shown on the screen. Each `PanelContainer` creates zero or more sub-containers to
do this, concrete logic depends on the type of the `PanelContainer`. TomTom Digital Cockpit comes
with a set of `PanelContainer`s, sub-containers and their layout files to cover the needs of the
stock system UI. It also allows to provide custom layouts for sub-containers.

This directory contains an example that uses a custom sub-container layout with a default
`PanelContainer`. It's possible to see this customization in action by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in Android Studio.
3. Run the `examples_customization_customsubcontainerlayout` configuration.
4. Tap any main menu item.
5. See the border around the main content of the screen. This border comes from the
custom layout file of the sub-container of the task panel container.

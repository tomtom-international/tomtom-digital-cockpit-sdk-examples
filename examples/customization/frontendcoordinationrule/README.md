# Adding a custom frontend coordination rule to a frontend

The business logic that coordinates the [Frontend]s within a system UI can be customized by
custom [FrontendCoordinationRule]s, which are explained in this example.

This directory contains an example that adds a custom [FrontendCoordinationRule] that closes debug
panel when any main menu item is tapped. It's possible to see this customization in action by
following these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open this in Android Studio.
3. Run the `examples_customization_frontendcoordinationrule` configuration.
4. Hold volume down hardware button.
5. See debug menu on the right of the screen.
6. Tap a main menu item.
7. See debug menu being closed.

If you want to learn how this works, start at the `frontendCoordinator` field of the
[CustomSystemUiViewModel](https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-digital-cockpit-sdk-examples/blob/main/examples/customization/frontendcoordinationrule/src/main/kotlin/com/example/ivi/example/systemui/frontendcoordinationrule/systemui/CustomSystemUiViewModel.kt)
. The frontend coordinator adds a custom `FrontendCoordinationRule` to the collection of default
rules.

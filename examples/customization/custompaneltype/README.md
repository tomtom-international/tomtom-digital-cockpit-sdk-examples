# Adding a custom panel type to the system UI

The System UI in the TomTom Digital Cockpit visualizes data represented by `Panel`s. They are the main
building blocks of the system UI. Each `Frontend` that has a UI adds one or
more new `Panel`s to visualize itself. The
[System UI Overview](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-digital-cockpit/designers/system-ui/overview)
page introduces the anatomy of the system UI and contains examples of built-in `Panel` types.
Their implementations can be found in the package
`com.tomtom.ivi.platform.frontend.api.common.frontend.panels`.

If none of the built-in `Panel` types are suitable to visualize your data, you can implement a
custom `Panel` types for your system UI. This directory contains an example that shown how to do
this. It's possible to see this customization in action by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in Android Studio.
3. Run the `examples_customization_custompaneltype` configuration.
4. See the custom panel on the left of the screen.
